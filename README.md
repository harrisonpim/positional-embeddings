# ðŸ”¢ Positional embeddings

The code in this repo is used top create the results and visualisations for the blog post: [Understanding positional embeddings in transformer models](https://harrisonpim.com/blog)

## ðŸ“¦ Running with devcontainers

This project uses [vscode devcontainers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) to maximise the reproducibility of the results. To recreate it, you'll need [docker](https://www.docker.com/), [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and the [remote containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers).

Opening this project in vscode will allow you to build the devcontainer with all of its dependencies.

## ðŸŒ³ Running without devcontainers

If you don't want to use devcontainers, you can still run the notebook(s) locally by installing the dependencies in `.devcontainer/requirements.txt`, and running `jupyter notebook` in the root of the repository.
