# ðŸ”¢ Positional embeddings

The code in this repo accompanies a blog post: [Understanding positional embeddings in transformer models](https://harrisonpim.com/blog)

## ðŸ“¦ Prerequisites

To ensure a fully reproducible environment, this project uses [vscode devcontainers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers).  
The container is based on the [jupyter/scipy-notebook](https://hub.docker.com/r/jupyter/scipy-notebook) image, and includes a few extra packages.

## ðŸš€ Getting started

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the repository in VS Code
3. Open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P)
4. Run the command `Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container`
5. Open the file `notebooks/positional-embeddings.ipynb`
